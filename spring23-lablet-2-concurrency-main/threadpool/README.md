Run one server instance with three clients running at the same time. Do you observe any problems?
What if you close one of the clients? Describe how you can solve the problem  and briefly explain. 
Hint: There are two possible solutions. One method involves changing the server code and requires 
no changes to the client code. Another method changes the client code and requires no changes to 
the server code.  Try to figure out both solutions.
